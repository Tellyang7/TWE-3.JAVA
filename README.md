# TWE-3.JAVA

# TWE-3 (in JAVA)
- It is the implementation of TWE-3, rewritten by JAVA. As the original project in Python cannot be run in my machine successful, I have to take several weeks (embarrassing for my poor ability to read the Cython code) to rewrite it.
- Original can be found in: [TWE-3](https://github.com/thunlp/topical_word_embeddings/tree/master/TWE-3) 

## usage:
- 1. Get the [gibbslda++](http://gibbslda.sourceforge.net/), run it and get the tassign file and the wordmap.txt 
- 2. Use the command: java main wordmap_filename tassign_filename to run the TWE-3 
- 3. Output file are under the directory output: word_vector.txt and topic_vector.txt
